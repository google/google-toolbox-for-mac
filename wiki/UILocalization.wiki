#summary Use of GTMUILocalizer and GTMUILocalizerAndLayoutTweaker for runtime localization and layout adjustment

<wiki:toc max_depth="2" />

= Introduction =

Mac OS X supports loading nib files out of language folders to provide a means of localization ([http://developer.apple.com/internationalization/localization/ Apple's Localization Documentation]).  However depending on the complexity of a product's UI, that can greatly enlarge the size of the resulting application bundle.  GTM provides some support for doing basic runtime localization so developer don't need to maintain copies of their nibs for every language.

= `GTMUILocalizer` =

`GTMUILocalizer` can be used from code or within a nib file to localize string data in a UI.  When used within a nib file, at `awakeFromNib`, it will walk the UI objects it is wired to, and attempt to localize all strings that start with a caret by looking them up in the `.strings` files to get the translations.  You can also subclass `GTMUILocalizer` to override how the strings are looked up to put some other backend in place.  Please see the [http://code.google.com/p/google-toolbox-for-mac/source/browse/trunk/AppKit/GTMUILocalizer.h header file] for more details on how to use `GTMUILocalizer`.

= `GTMUILocalizerAndLayoutTweaker` =

When localizing a UI, it is not uncommon that the UI needs to have some of its size/layout adjusted to handle the different string lengths that can result from translation.  `GTMUILocalizerAndLayoutTweaker` builds on `GTMUILocalizer` to provide some simple adjustments to UIs so you can avoid having to maintain multiple nib files.  Since it is just about impossible to handle all possible needs, `GTMUILocalizerAndLayoutTweaker` provides some flexibility in how it is used:
  * You can use it on a per window/view bases.  In that you can let it fix up just some of your UI, and handle the rest other ways (though your own code, through `.lproj` folders, etc.).
  * You can use it with a nib file living in `Application.app/Contents/Resources` to handle most locales, then for the small number of locales that still need some more manual tweaking, you can maintain a nib specific to those languages in the right `.lproj` subfolder.

The [http://code.google.com/p/google-toolbox-for-mac/source/browse/trunk/AppKit/GTMUILocalizerAndLayoutTweaker.h header file] for `GTMUILocalizerAndLayoutTweaker` gives a basic overview of what is possible, but this is one of those case where some examples and pictures can greatly help; so with further delay...

== Nib Setup ==

Add a new `NSObject` to your nib file, and set the class to `GTMUILocalizerAndLayoutTweaker`.  Then wire the `localizerOwner_` outlet to the nib owner, and wire the `uiObject_` to the object that you want to be localized and _tweaked_ (a window or view).

If you need a custom subclass of `GTMUILocalizer`, you can also add that to the nib and wire the `localizer_` outlet to it (when you don't provide this, a stock `GTMUILocalizer` is used, and the `localizerOwner_` is used so it can figure out where to load its strings for localization.

_NOTE:_ Do *not* wire up any of the `GTMUILocalizer`'s outlets, see the next section for why.

== `awakeFromNib` Work ==

When the `GTMUILocalizerAndLayoutTweaker` receives `awakeFromNib` it does the following, in order:
  # If `localizer_` is unset, creates a `GTMUILocalizer`.
  # Passes `uiObject_` to `localizer_` to have all marked strings in the UI localized.
  # Recursively walks the hierarchy of `uiObject_` looking for instances of `GTMWidthBasedTweaker` and letting them do their layout work.

_NOTE_: Step 2 is an important detail here.  You do not want to wire up any outlets from a `GTMUILocalizer` you are using with a `GTMUILocalizerAndLayoutTweaker `.  The order that all `awakeFromNib` methods are called is not well defined (it depends on the graph created by the objects in the nib, [http://devworld.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/ApplicationKit/Protocols/NSNibAwaking_Protocol/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/instm/NSObject/awakeFromNib Apple's docs on awakeFromNib]), so there is no way to say for sure that the `GTMUILocalizer` will get awoken before the `GTMUILocalizerAndLayoutTweaker`.

== `GTMWidthBasedTweaker` ==

`GTMWidthBasedTweaker` is a custom `NSView` that causes its children to try and size to their content.  Basically, it loops over its children calling `sizeToFit` on any that support the selector, and then tries to use their layout and `autosizingMask` to get them in the right positions.  Base on the size changes of its children, it can optional adjust other objects.

=== _Example:_ A row of buttons right align to the window ===

Create the nib file, and set the titles to be your localization keys:

 http://google-toolbox-for-mac.googlecode.com/svn/site/wiki-images/button_row_initial.png 

Then select the two buttons and tell Interface Builder to embed the objects into a Custom View, and set the class of that view to `GTMWidthBasedTweaker`.  Set the struts on the `GTMWidthBasedTweaker` so it is anchored to the bottom and right but unanchored to the top and left.

 http://google-toolbox-for-mac.googlecode.com/svn/site/wiki-images/button_row_setup.png http://google-toolbox-for-mac.googlecode.com/svn/site/wiki-images/a_r_b.png

Wire in the `GTMUILocalizerAndLayoutTweaker`, and at runtime, you'll see something like this:

 http://google-toolbox-for-mac.googlecode.com/svn/site/wiki-images/button_row_result.png

=== _Example:_ A couple of checkboxes that keep the clickable areas limited to text length ===

Create the nib file, and set the titles to be your localization keys:

 http://google-toolbox-for-mac.googlecode.com/svn/site/wiki-images/cbox_list_initial.png 

Then select the checkboxes and tell Interface Builder to embed the objects into a Custom View, and set the class of that view to `GTMWidthBasedTweaker`.  Set the struts on the `GTMWidthBasedTweaker` so it is anchored to the top and left but unanchored to the bottom and right.

 http://google-toolbox-for-mac.googlecode.com/svn/site/wiki-images/cbox_list_setup.png http://google-toolbox-for-mac.googlecode.com/svn/site/wiki-images/a_l_t.png

Wire in the `GTMUILocalizerAndLayoutTweaker`, and at runtime, you'll see something like this:

 http://google-toolbox-for-mac.googlecode.com/svn/site/wiki-images/cbox_list_result.png

=== _Example:_ A label and a text field where as the the label grows/shrinks for its text, the text field will move and grow/shrink to consume balance the label ===

Create the nib file, and set the title to be your localization key:

 http://google-toolbox-for-mac.googlecode.com/svn/site/wiki-images/label_field_initial.png 

Then select the label and tell Interface Builder to embed the object into a Custom View, and set the class of that view to `GTMWidthBasedTweaker`.  Set the struts on the `GTMWidthBasedTweaker` so it is anchored to the top and left but unanchored to the bottom and right.

 http://google-toolbox-for-mac.googlecode.com/svn/site/wiki-images/label_field_setup.png http://google-toolbox-for-mac.googlecode.com/svn/site/wiki-images/a_l_t.png

Now wire the `viewToSlideAndResize_` outlet of the `GTMWidthBasedTweaker` to the text field. Lastly, wire in the `GTMUILocalizerAndLayoutTweaker`, and at runtime, you'll see something like this:

 http://google-toolbox-for-mac.googlecode.com/svn/site/wiki-images/label_field_result.png

=== _Example:_ A set of labels and a text fields that stay aligned and the text field balances the label size changes ===

Create the nib file, and set the title to be your localization key:

 http://google-toolbox-for-mac.googlecode.com/svn/site/wiki-images/labels_fields_initial.png 

Then select the labels and tell Interface Builder to embed the objects into a Custom View, set the class of that view to `GTMWidthBasedTweaker`.  Then select the text fields and embed them in a Box.  The box should be made transparent, but in the the diagram below we're making it visible so you can see what the setup looks like:

 http://google-toolbox-for-mac.googlecode.com/svn/site/wiki-images/labels_fields_setup.png

Set the struts on the `GTMWidthBasedTweaker` so it is anchored to the top and left but unanchored to the bottom and right.

 http://google-toolbox-for-mac.googlecode.com/svn/site/wiki-images/a_l_t.png

Make sure the labels within the `GTMWidthBasedTweaker` are anchored on the right but unanchored on the left (so they will line up against the text fields per UI guidelines).

 http://google-toolbox-for-mac.googlecode.com/svn/site/wiki-images/a_r_t.png

Lastly, text fields within the box are set to be anchored to the top, left and right, and have there width adjust with the box they are in.

 http://google-toolbox-for-mac.googlecode.com/svn/site/wiki-images/a_l_r_t_g_w.png

Now wire the `viewToSlideAndResize_` outlet of the `GTMWidthBasedTweaker` to the box that is enclosing the text fields.  Lastly, wire in the `GTMUILocalizerAndLayoutTweaker`, and at runtime, you'll see something like this:

 http://google-toolbox-for-mac.googlecode.com/svn/site/wiki-images/labels_fields_result.png

As the Tweaker grows or shirks based on the localization, it keeps the box holding the text fields next to it and makes it grown/shirk as needed.  The springs and struts on the text fields within that box are what make them size to match.

=== _Example:_ A label and a text field where as the the label grows/shrinks for its text, the text field will move and grow/shrink to consume balance the label and a second label under the text field will be kept insync with it ===

Create the nib file, and set the title to be your localization key:

 http://google-toolbox-for-mac.googlecode.com/svn/site/wiki-images/with_slide_initial.png 

Then select the label and tell Interface Builder to embed the object into a Custom View, and set the class of that view to `GTMWidthBasedTweaker`.  Set the struts on the `GTMWidthBasedTweaker` so it is anchored to the top and left but unanchored to the bottom and right.

 http://google-toolbox-for-mac.googlecode.com/svn/site/wiki-images/with_slide_setup.png http://google-toolbox-for-mac.googlecode.com/svn/site/wiki-images/a_l_t.png

Now wire the `viewToSlideAndResize_` outlet of the `GTMWidthBasedTweaker` to the text field. Wire the `viewToSlide_` outlet to the label under the text field. Lastly, wire in the `GTMUILocalizerAndLayoutTweaker`, and at runtime, you'll see something like this:

 http://google-toolbox-for-mac.googlecode.com/svn/site/wiki-images/with_slide_result.png

=== _Example:_ A label with a horizontal line that grows/shrinks with the label ===

Create the nib file, and set the title to be your localization key:

 http://google-toolbox-for-mac.googlecode.com/svn/site/wiki-images/with_resize_initial.png 

Then select the label and tell Interface Builder to embed the object into a Custom View, and set the class of that view to `GTMWidthBasedTweaker`.  Set the struts on the `GTMWidthBasedTweaker` so it is anchored to the top and left but unanchored to the bottom and right.

 http://google-toolbox-for-mac.googlecode.com/svn/site/wiki-images/with_resize_setup.png http://google-toolbox-for-mac.googlecode.com/svn/site/wiki-images/a_l_t.png

Now wire the `viewToResize_` outlet of the `GTMWidthBasedTweaker` to the horizontal line. Lastly, wire in the `GTMUILocalizerAndLayoutTweaker`, and at runtime, you'll see something like this:

 http://google-toolbox-for-mac.googlecode.com/svn/site/wiki-images/with_resize_result.png

=== _Example:_ A label and a text field, how much the label grows/shrinks, the text field will move over and then the window will resize to match the label width change ===

Create the nib file, and set the title to be your localization key:

 http://google-toolbox-for-mac.googlecode.com/svn/site/wiki-images/resize_window_initial.png 

Then select the label and tell Interface Builder to embed the object into a Custom View, and set the class of that view to `GTMWidthBasedTweaker`.

 http://google-toolbox-for-mac.googlecode.com/svn/site/wiki-images/resize_window_setup.png

Set the struts on the `GTMWidthBasedTweaker` so it is anchored to the top and left but unanchored to the bottom and right.

 http://google-toolbox-for-mac.googlecode.com/svn/site/wiki-images/a_l_t.png

Set the struts of the Text Field so it is anchored to the top, left, and right and its width with resize with the window.

 http://google-toolbox-for-mac.googlecode.com/svn/site/wiki-images/a_l_r_t_g_w.png

Now wire the `viewToSlideAndResize_` outlet of the `GTMWidthBasedTweaker` to the text field.  Wire the `viewToResize_` outlet to the window.  Lastly, wire in the `GTMUILocalizerAndLayoutTweaker`, and at runtime, you'll see something like this:

 http://google-toolbox-for-mac.googlecode.com/svn/site/wiki-images/resize_window_result.png

This may seem odd, but what happens is the text field will grow/shrink by the opposite amount the label changed size.  Then the window size will be adjusted by the same amount that the label changed size, putting the text field back at the size it was to start with.

=== _Example:_ Using more then one `GTMWidthBasedTweaker` ===

You can use more then one `GTMWidthBasedTweaker` to handle your layout.  But you really can only have one set to use its `viewToResize_` to point at the window.  But the combine effects can result in things like:

Initial setup:

With the `GTMWidthBasedTweaker`s added:
