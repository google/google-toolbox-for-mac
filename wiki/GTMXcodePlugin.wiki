= Introduction =

The GTM Xcode plugin adds a couple of nice features to Xcode.
   # A preference to clean up end of line white space from text files.
   # A "Create Unit Test Executable" menu item to make it easier to debug unit tests.
   # Some quick links under the "Help" menu to some useful documentation. 
   # Some menu items for working with [http://code.google.com/p/coverstory/ Coverstory]

It is available under [http://code.google.com/p/google-toolbox-for-mac/downloads/list downloads]. 
= Installation =
The install path is a little difficult, but the plugin should be extracted from its Zip file and should be put into:

  * "/Library/Application Support/Developer/3.1/Xcode/Plug-ins" for development on Leopard

and

  * "/Developer/Library/Xcode/Plug-ins" for development on Snow Leopard

Once it is in place, restart Xcode, and you should have a "About GTM Xcode Plugin" menu item under the Xcode menu. If you don't have this item, please check the location you installed it and try again.

If you run into any problems, please log them at:

== Xcode 4 Support ==

*NOTE:* The plugin currently does *NOT* support Xcode 4.  Xcode 4 was a rewrite by Apple, so the plugin will probably have to be rewritten, that has not been done.

= Version History =

  * 10.0.2 - Fixed some problems with custom absolute builds paths.
  * 10.0.3 - Now does a better job with determining OBJC_DISABLE_GC and working with hosts with relative paths for Custom Unit Test Executables.
  * 10.0.4 - Now picks up the active architecture properly when finding code coverage files.
  * 10.0.5 - Fix up small version numbering problem. No new features.
